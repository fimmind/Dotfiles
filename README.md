* Exhaustive documentation (At least short description)
* System installation instructions
* Setup default applications
* Setup windows layout using [this](https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html) article
* (Neo)Vim:
  * Try [vim-lion](https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-lion) instead of
    vim-easy-motion
  * Setup `Joker` linting with
    [efm-langserver](https://github.com/mattn/efm-langserver) and `coc.nvim`
    instead of ALE
  * Same mappings for vim-iced and ALE as for coc.nvim
  * General REPL mapping. Maybe with [vim-repl](https://github.com/sillybun/vim-repl)
  * Setup coc-eslint
  * Try to setup and use [floskell](https://github.com/ennocramer/floskell)
